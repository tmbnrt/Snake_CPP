# Snake_CPP

A classic Snake game implemented in modern C++ using the SDL2 framework.

This project was created to explore **keyboard interaction in C++** and to gain hands-on experience with **event-driven programming using SDL2**. It also served as a practical exercise in modular game logic and real-time input handling.
